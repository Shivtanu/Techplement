Steps to Use-

Run the Script: Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt using: python week1.py

Provide Input: Answer the prompts to specify the password length and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Get Password: The script will generate and display a random password based on your inputs.

This approach simplifies user interaction by directly taking inputs from the console and generates a secure, random password.
